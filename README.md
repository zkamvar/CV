# Zhian N. Kamvar's CV

This is a repository for Zhian N. Kamvar's Curriculum Vitae and it's changes. No
material here may be used for commercial purposes.

This CV utilizes a modified version of [moderncv][0] version 1.2.0. I believe
many of the modifications had to do with spacing and removing elements deemed
unnecessary.

To render the CV on a UNIX system, use make:

```
make
make clean
``` 

The CV is made up of various sections using the `\input{}` tag. These sections
live in the [tex/][1] folder.
