I am applying for the position of Software Research Scientist, which I saw 
advertised in mid-July of 2019. Currently, I work as a Research Software
Engineer at Imperial College London working to develop user-friendly and robust
software packages for outbreak analyitcs. My formal training, however, is in
the population genetics of plant pathogens, where I developed the widely-used
R package \textit{poppr} that implemented population genetic analyses suitable
for clonal, partially clonal, and/or sexual populations. The overarching goal in
my work is to implement methods for analysis that are clear, accurate,
consistent, and easy to use.

% - State qualifications, broadly
% - Add support
Having worked as both a research scientist and research software engineer, I am
excited for the opportunity to collaborate with the rOpenSci team. I have all of
the preferred skills and qualifications necessary for this position including
a degree in a quantitative field (population genetics), expertise in open-source
R package development (\url{https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr}), strong
technical writing skills (scientific: \url{https://peerj.com/articles/4152/}, 
documentation: \url{https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr/reference/psex.html}), 
experience in collaborative projects (e.g.: \url{https://R4EPIs.netilfy.com}),
and a strong passion for improving the inclusiveness and and accssibility of
reproducible science. 



% MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

% - A Master's degree in statistics, computer science, or a related field with
%     a focus on quantitative methodologies, or equivalent experience in
%     statistical methods evaluation and development
% - Expertise in open-source R package development, including collaborative
%     development using Git and GitHub, testing frameworks, and continuous
%     integration
% - Strong writing skills
% - Experience in collaborative team projects and consensus building
% - A passion for improving scientific reproducibility

% DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS

% - Participate in other projects and tasks as required or assigned by
%     supervisor

I believe that my background in quantitative science, robust software
development, collaborative capacity, and passion for both equity and 
fairness in peer review makes me well-suited to join the team as a software
research scientist. If you wish to contact me, I am available at +44 7444 840264
or by email at xxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com. Thank you for your time and consideration,
I look forward to hearing from you.
