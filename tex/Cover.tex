I am applying for the position of Software Research Scientist, which I saw 
advertised in mid-July of 2019. Currently, I work as a Research Software
Engineer at Imperial College London working to develop user-friendly and robust
software packages for outbreak analyitcs. My formal training, however, is in
the population genetics of plant pathogens, where I developed the widely-used
R package \textit{poppr} that implemented population genetic analyses suitable
for clonal, partially clonal, and/or sexual populations. The overarching goal in
my work is to implement methods for analysis that are accurate, consistent, and
easy to use.
