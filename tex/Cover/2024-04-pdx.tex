I found the DevOps Lead position through a post 
Mastodon\footnote{\url{https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/112288252467110280}} 
I am confident that I will excel in
this role because in my \textbf{10 years in interdisciplinary open source
scientific software development}, I have always focused on usability,
reproducibility, and flexibility in my design.
In my previous role as a software engineer at The Carpentries, I developed
infrastructure that supports researchers and educators in developing lessons
for data science training.
My background in \textbf{science communication}, discipline in collaborative
software engineering practices (test driven development, CI/CD, trunk-based
workflows, and project management), and \textbf{eagerness to learn and apply
new skillsets} makes me an ideal candidate for this position. 
I am particularly excited to work in a role that will support researchers in
understand the environmental challenges so they can make critical decisions
that will have real impacts for our world.


% details describing your education, training and/or experience, and where
% obtained, which clearly reflects your qualifications 

\vspace{2ex}

% \textbf{Experience in DevOps, software development, or IT operations, with a proven track record in automation, CI/CD, and operational excellence.}\\
As an open source software enginer, I have a \textbf{proven track record in automation, CI/CD, and operational excellence}.
Above all, in all of my projects, the \textbf{quality of the user experience} has driven my designs.
Since 2013, I have been developing scientific software, relying heavily on automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and quality controls at multiple levels.
In my previous role, I \textbf{developed an automated, secure, and platform-independent deployment system} for our community-maintained lesson infrastructure that has been operational since 2021\footnote{Deployment System: \url{https://carpentries.github.io/workbench-dev/remote/intro.html}}. 
I employed unit and integration tests on CI that would run weekly\footnote{Testing Strategies: \url{https://carpentries.github.io/workbench-dev/testing.html}} testing pre-release versions combined with a detailed release process ensured the robustness and security of our infrastructure\footnote{Release Strategy: \url{https://carpentries.github.io/workbench-dev/releases.html}}.

\vspace{2ex}

% \textbf{Knowledge of DevOps tools and practices (e.g., Jenkins, Git, Docker), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), scripting (Python, Bash), and security fundamentals.}\\

Working with a large and distributed volunteer community allowed me to strengthen my \textbf{DevOps tools and practices}. 
We used \textbf{Git, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and AWS} to convert a difficult to update lesson deployment system to one with \textbf{automated updates and monitoring}.
Within this system we also \textbf{created failsafes to prevent malicious code entering a community-maintained repository.} 

\vspace{2ex}

% \textbf{Experience leading and mentoring teams in a technological environment, including utilizing strong project management skills.}\\

From 2018 to 2020 I was the Director of Software Development at the R Epidemics Consortium where I lead development of software for use in field epidemiological situations. 
In my most recent role, I was responsible for modifying our existing lesson infrastructure to be scalable, automated, and user-friendly.
\textbf{I lead the effort to evaluate the tools, hire a designer, and coordinate alpha and beta testing of the infrastructure.}
After coordinating and executing a major transition of public-facing infrastructure that serves tens of thousands of people each year, \textbf{I mentored
three of my colleagues in DevOps, automation, accessibility, and maintenance} of this infrastructure.
This included regular training sessions and one-on-one personal project sessions.

\vspace{2ex}

% \textbf{Ability to exercise excellent communication skills, both verbally and in writing, including conveying complex technical ideas and processes to a variety of audiences.}\\
I have been teaching people to work with code, data, and perform reproducible research since 2014. 
As a certified Carpentries Instructor Trainer, experienced in evidence-based active learning principles, I incorporate several forms of feedback within my instruction and modify it to the audience, ensuring that understanding of the material is achieved. 
I have written several tutorials, manual pages, and reference guides.

Sincerely,
