\textbf{To: Reich Lab Hiring Mangager}\\

\vspace{2ex}

With \textbf{more than 10 years in interdisciplinary open-source scientific software development} %my background in \textbf{science communication}, 
with a strong focus on \textbf{collaborative DevOps tools and practices}, %established track record of \textbf{project management and leadership}, and \textbf{eagerness to learn and apply new skillsets} makes me 
I am an ideal candidate for this position. 
I was a software engineer for The Carpentries (a non-profit in education with a large and distributed volunteer community) where I developed \textit{The Carpentries Workbench}, \textbf{an automated, secure}, and platform-independent deployment system for their community-maintained lesson \textbf{infrastructure that has been in continuous operation since 2021}\footnote{\textit{The Carpentries Workbench}: \url{https://carpentries.github.io/workbench}}.%\footnote{Deployment System: \url{https://carpentries.github.io/workbench-dev/remote/intro.html}}.
I am particularly excited to work in a role that will support public health
researchers rapidly share and validate models that can help inform policies
and actions that will help circumvent future pandemics.

\underline{\textbf{Development experience:}}
I have been collaboratively \textbf{developing, documenting, and testing} open source software \textbf{on GitHub since 2013} in the disciplines of population genetics, epidemiology, and education.
Most recently, I was the lead for \textit{The Carpentries Workbench}, 
a suite of R packages and \textbf{CI/CD workflows} designed to build, deploy, and audit reproducible data science lessons in a \textbf{secure and platform indpendent} manner.
This was a ground-up redesign of the lesson infrastructure to \textbf{focus on
the needs and working practices of our diverse community of \textgreater2000 volunteers},
allowing them to focus on the content of their lesson and not the tooling.

\underline{\textbf{Organizational Skills}}
I operate under a \textbf{growth mindset} and am \textbf{always learning}.
The work I did in academia (2012--2020) taught me many of the DevOps practices I have now.
As a grad worker, I developed \textbf{project management skills} creating user-friendly scientific software\footnote{poppr R package (Kamvar \textit{et al.}, 2014) doi: \href{https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.281}{10.7717/peerj.281} featured in \textbf{\textgreater2000 peer-reviewed publications}} on \textbf{Linux} with \textbf{Git} and \textbf{CI} and 
performed complex simulation analyses using \textbf{automation with Python and BASH}.
In my postdoctoral work, I used \textbf{Docker} for automated reproducible research\footnote{Automated Research using Docker + CircleCI (Kamvar \textit{et al.}, 2017) doi: \href{https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4152}{10.7717/peerj.4152}}, 
and was an early adopter of \textbf{GitHub Actions} for CI/CD to manage deployments with limited resources.
My work at The Carpentries (2020--2023) gave me the \textbf{learning opportunity} to \textbf{scale my DevOps skills} by allowing me to work with \textbf{monitoring frameworks and deployments on AWS} and \textbf{securely managing personally identifiable information}. 

\vspace{2ex}

\underline{\textbf{Collaborations and Leadership:}}
I have \textbf{\textgreater5 years of leadership experience} through my work in the non-profit space in the R4Epis project (2018--2019) and The Carpentries (2020--2023).
At R4Epis, I \textbf{coordinated testing, development, and deployment} of software for field epidemiologists with limited computing resources.
By providing intial documentation for technical configuration via offline resources along with on-demand remote support via synchronous and asynchronous communications, I was able to set them up for success.
% My role in The Carpentries started with \textbf{vendor and tool management} for their infrastructure, including \textbf{hiring and evaluating contractors} for accessible UI design work.
I put my \textbf{strong mentorship skills} to work in 2023 when I \textbf{trained 3 novice colleages in code review, automation, and maintenance} of our infrastructure.


\vspace{2ex}

\underline{\textbf{Communication skills:}}
I am the co-founder of an award-winning \textbf{science communication podcast} where I coached graduate workers to \textbf{explain complex technical ideas} to a general audience (2012--2016).
As a certified Carpentries Instructor Trainer, I have been \textbf{teaching people to work with data and code since 2014} using \textbf{evidence-based active learning principles.} 
And finally, much of the success for my projects lies with my ability to \textbf{write clear and concice documentation tailored to the audience}.


\vspace{2ex}
The experience I have gained in over a decade has given me the experience needed to be a valuable asset to the lab. 
I am particularly excited for the opportunity to work in the public health sector again.
I would like to thank the recruitment team for consideration of my application.

Sincerely,
