I am an experienced software developer of several packages for population
genetics and epidemiology in the R programming language listed below. My goal
in software development is to ensure that my applications are \textbf{open},
and \textbf{accessible} to researchers regardless of computational skills. Above
all, I aim to make sure that my software is robust, consistent, and correct
through test-driven development practices.
