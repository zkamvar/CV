I am an experienced devops engineer of several packages for population
genetics, epidemiology, and static web publishing in the R programming language
listed below. My goal in software development is to ensure that my applications
are \textbf{open}, and \textbf{accessible} to researchers regardless of
computational skills. Above all, I aim to make sure that my software is robust,
consistent, and correct through careful design and test-driven development
practices.
