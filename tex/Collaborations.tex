I have taken a leading role in the following inter-organizational collaborations
\newline{}

\cventry{2018--Present}{The R4EPIs Project}{with RECON and MSF}{}{}{
  This collaboration between MSF (Doctors Without Borders) and the RECON (R
  Epidemics Consortium) aims to provide a set of situation report templates in
  RMarkdown with standardized data cleaning and summary statistics for reports
  on four common outbreak scenarios and three surveys.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed code for summary statistics tailored to the expectations of
    MSF field epidemiologists.
    \item Wrote tests for numerical and structural accuracy.
    \item Reviewed contributed templates.
    \item Lead remote collaborative sessions with epidemiologists testing
    templates on their own data, updating templates and code to avoid common
    pitfalls.
    \item Website: \url{https://r4epis.netlify.com}
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2016}{Hackout3}{Hackathon}{Berkeley Institute of Data Science}{June 20--24}{
	 Hackout 3 brought together field epidemiologists, decision makers, modelers
	 and computer scientists to create free, open-source resources for the 
	 real-time monitoring of disease outbreaks. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tools for detecting near duplicates in line list data designed for data managers on the ground.
    \item Tools for data cleaning, and disease modeling.
    \item Creation of the R Epidemics Consortium: \url{http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/}
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2014}{Population Genetics in R}{Hackathon}{NESCent}{March 16--20}{
	 The event aimed to help foster an interoperating ecosystem of scalable
	 tools and resources for population genetics data analysis in the popular R
	 platform.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Website for community contributed tutorials on population genetic analysis in R \url{http://popgen.nescent.org} 
    \item New tools for analyzing multiple gene phylogenies in R \url{http://cran.r-project.org/package=apex}
    \item New contributions to the core data structure of the \textit{adegenet} package
    \item Special issue of Molecular Ecology: \textbf{Population Genomics in R}
  \end{itemize}
