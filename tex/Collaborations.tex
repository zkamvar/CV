I have taken a leading role in the following inter-organizational collaborations


\cventry{2018--Present}{The R4EPIs Project}{with RECON and MSF}{}{}{
  This collaboration between MSF (Doctors Without Borders) and the RECON (R
  Epidemics Consortium) aims to provide a set of situation report templates in
  RMarkdown with standardized data cleaning and summary statistics for reports
  on four common outbreak scenarios and three surveys.
  \newline{}
  My role as technical co-lead was:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop code for summary statistics tailored to the expectations of
    MSF field epidemiologists.
    \item Wrote tests for numerical and structural accuracy.
    \item Reviewed contributed templates.
    \item Lead remote collaborative sessions with epidemiologists testing
    templates on their own data. 
  \end{itemize}
